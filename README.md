# European-Soccer-League-Analysis
For this project we are going to look at the European Soccer Database. This database has comprehensive details of the following:

+25,000 matches  
+10,000 players  
11 European Countries with their lead championship  
Seasons 2008 to 2016  
Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates  
Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)  
Betting odds from up to 10 providers  
Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etcâ€¦) for +10,000 matches  

The aim of this project is to analyse the data and try to find out the best performing teams and players, how much they have improved and what attributes impact a player's rating. We will visualize our findings for quick and easy explanation of our findings.  

The analysis is based on a kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer  
# Questions and Aim of Analysis:
We have asked the following four questions of our data and done a deep analysis to find answers to those questions. The questions are as follows:  

1. What are the top 10 teams when it comes to number of victories and goals scored over a period of 8 seasons (2008-2016)?  
2. Which teams improved the most over the time period?  
3. Which players have scored the highest number of penalties?  
4. Who are the highest rated players and what attributes in a player are important for a higher rating?  

# Findings:
Here are our findings from analysing the seven tables in the database:

1. The top 10 teams based on total wins and goals scored are presented in the following charts: 
a. By wins:

2. The teams that improved the most over time, with respect to number of wins per season or total goals per season are presented in the following charts:  
a. By wins, sorted in descending order of difference beween maximum and minimum wins

# Concluding comments:

The database is quite extensive and contains many details about the European Soccer Leagues. If time and scope permit, we can dig further and uncover some other, quite interesting insights. We might be able to use the data to predict future wins to a certain degree of accracy. We will pin this as the future scope of this project.
